Problem 1
Print the following pattern
     1
    1 1
   1 2 1
  1 3 3 1
 1 4 6 4 1

Observe how the nunmbers in the triangle are calculated. 
Do it in two steps. Work on the generating the numbers first in right angle triangle
1
1 1
1 2 1
1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1

And then work on the final output using proper indendation

Problem #2
Read a passage from a file. 
Count the number of times the word 'the' followed by another 'the' without 'a' in between.

Eg The king went to the forest with the wife and a servernt. The king shot a deer. The king went to the forest again the next day.

answer is 4 (The king, the forest, The King the next).
