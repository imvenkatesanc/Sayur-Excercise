Problem #1
Wrote a program for seat reservation in a theatre.
You can decide on the configuaration of the seats (no of rows and no of seats in each row, and a passage in between)
When the user asks for tickets, you need to provide them tickets in the form of seat no.
For eg, User ask for 3 seats in the middle. Output is F11, F12 , F13
Print the theatre configuaration at the end of each transaction.

Problem #2
Same problem as above. Also calculate tickets price. 
Firsrt 3 rows - Rs100
Rows 4 to 12 - Rs 200
Rows 13 till top - Rs 300.
3 seats close to the wall on both sides costs less than the other seats in the same row.
